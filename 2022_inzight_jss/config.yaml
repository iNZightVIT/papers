abstract: "Visualisation, exploration, and analysis of data are often inaccessible to many due to high up-front costs of learning the necessary coding skills to get started. \\Glspl{gui} allow inexperienced users to gain access to these skills by removing the need for coding. However, currently available \\proglang{R} \\glspl{gui} require some degree of experience with \\proglang{R} and familiarity with many statistical concepts. \\pkg{iNZight}, a \\gls{gui} written in R, enables both students and researchers to interact with and explore data without coding and needing only minimal statistical knowledge. The tool is designed to be easy to use, with intuitive controls, clever defaults for common tasks and other design features to lower the barriers to entry and significantly decrease the time lost learning or relearning the software. Generalists in a range of organisations, including government, can quickly and efficiently obtain official statistics for reporting purposes. \\pkg{iNZight} also provides more complex features for manipulation and analysis of data, handling of complex survey designs, and includes some code-writing capabilities for researchers to efficiently generate reproducible output or as a pathway for those looking to learn the basics of \\proglang{R}."
