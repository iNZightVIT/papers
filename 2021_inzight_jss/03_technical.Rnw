\section{Technical details}\label{sec:technical}

\pkg{iNZight}'s interface is written with \proglang{R} using the three support packages \pkg{gWidgets2}, \pkg{gWidgets2RGtk2}, and \pkg{RGtk2}.
\pkg{gWidgets2} \citep{gWidgets2} provides a simple widget-based \gls{api} to building a cross-platform interface with \proglang{R}, with support for \pkg{Tcl/Tk} \citep{tcltk}, \pkg{Qt} \cite{qt}, and \pkg{GTK+ 2.0} \citep{gtk}.
We chose GTK2, as it was the most feature rich and---at the time---had the best cross-platform support (see \cref{sec:os-reqs}).
The GTK2 binaries are accessed through \proglang{R} using the \pkg{RGtk2} package \citep{RGtk2}, with commands translated from \pkg{gWidgets2} using the \pkg{gWidgest2RGtk2} package \citep{gWidgets2RGtk2}.
Together, these packages provide a platform-independent \gls{api} for creating a \gls{gui} with \proglang{R}.


\subsection{Component design}\label{sec:design}

The \gls{gui} for \pkg{iNZight} uses an \gls{oop} framework in \proglang{R} called \emph{reference classes} (from the \pkg{methods} packages included with the base \proglang{R} distribution).
The same framework is used by \pkg{gWidgets2} to describe individual components of the interface.
Each piece of the \gls{gui} is a \emph{class}, with individual buttons, methods (actions), and even smaller sub-components.
\Gls{oop} allows for \emph{inheritance}, so developers can describe a general class which can be shared by several related `child' components, but which may have different layouts or methods;
this drives \pkg{iNZight}'s add-on system (\cref{sec:addons}).
\Cref{fig:inzight_main_widgets} shows the \pkg{iNZight} \gls{gui} with some of the major class components annotated.

    \caption[The reference class components of the iNZight interface.]{\label{fig:inzight_main_widgets} The reference class components of the \pkg{iNZight} interface, some of which are themselves made from several child objects.}
\end{figure}

In addition to the ``visible'' class components, others exist behind-the-scenes, the main one being the \class{iNZDocument} class which stores the state of the application, including the data set, variable selection, any survey design information, and plot settings.
The \class{iNZDataNameWidget} component visible in the top-left of \cref{fig:inzight_main_widgets} displays a list of documents, allowing the user to switch between them.


The structure of each class is, in most cases, a set of attributes that the user can control, stored as \emph{properties} of the class.
There are also \emph{methods} which can be used by the class to react to user input or perform actions.
Most components have a main method which performs the primary function of the component,
for example, the \class{iNZFilterData} class contains a \fct{filter\_data} method which takes the user's input and performs the desired action.
A skeleton example of the \menu{Filter Data} window class is shown in \cref{lst:filter}.
In this oversimplified example, the user is given a drop-down \fct{gcombobox} to choose a variable to filter on.
When they click the \menu{Filter} button, the data is filtered and passed back to the main \gls{gui}.
The method uses \fct{switch} to select the appropriate wrapper function within the \pkg{iNZightTools} package based on the user's chosen value of ``type''.
The actual class for the \menu{Filter Data} method is more complicated, and includes reactive components so only the relevant inputs are displayed to the user.

\begin{lstfloat}[tp]
    \caption{Reference class definition for filter window example.}
    \label{lst:filter}
    \begin{Code}
    iNZFilterData <- setRefClass(
        "iNZFilterData",
        fields = list(
            GUI = "ANY",
            data = "data.frame",
            type = "ANY",
            variable = "ANY",
            operator = "ANY",
            value = "ANY",
            ...
        ),
        methods = list(
            initialize = function(gui) {
                initFields(GUI = gui, data = gui$getActiveData())
                # ... construct GUI inputs ...
                # e.g.,
                type <<- gradio(c("Numeric value", "Factor levels", "Random"))
                variable <<- gcombobox(colnames(data))
                okbtn <- gbutton("Filter", handler = function(h, ...) filter_data())
            },
            filter_data = function() {
                filtered_data <- switch(svalue(type, index = TRUE),
                    iNZightTools::filterNumeric(
                        data,
                        var = variable,
                        op = operator,
                        num = value),
                    ...
                )
                GUI$update_data(filtered_data)
            }
        )
    )
    \end{Code}
\end{lstfloat}


Each major component has a similar structure to \cref{lst:filter}, with calls to various functions, many of which come from other \pkg{iNZight*} packages.
Plots are generated by calls to \fct{iNZightPlots::inzplot}, while data import is handled by \fct{iNZightTools::smart\_read}.
The wrappers enforce separation of the interface and data logic so that the \gls{gui} is only concerned with receiving user input and displaying the output.

if (!file.exists("nls.dta"))
    download.file(url, "nls.dta")

\subsection{Code-writing wrapper functions}\label{sec:code-writing-wrappers}

Another advantage of having components calling external functions is that the wrapper functions can attach the lower-level \proglang{R} code used to generate the result, which the \gls{gui} can fetch from the returned data and attach to the script described in \cref{sec:code-writing}, all while keeping the \gls{gui} and data-oriented code separate.
Here is an example using \fct{iNZightTools::smart\_read}:
<<code_from_result>>=
library("iNZightTools")
data <- smart_read("nls.dta")
print_code(data)
@
The \fct{iNZightTools::code} function can also be used to get the \proglang{R} code attached to the resulting object, allowing beginner \proglang{R} users to see that the \pkg{haven} package \citep{haven} was used to read this \proglang{Stata} file (\code{.dta}).
Beginner \proglang{R} users need only learn the one function---\fct{smart\_read}---but can easily examine and modify the underlying code returned by \fct{smart\_read}.
In this way, novice \proglang{R} users can read a wide variety of datasets, and can very quickly adapt the provided code to fit unique situations by reading the documentation for the supplied function, rather than having to do the time consuming job of searching for the correct package and starting from scratch.


While the \gls{gui} packages provide the structure of the visual \gls{gui}, it's the collection of \proglang{R} packages developed alongside \pkg{iNZight} that power the program.
The main reason for creating separate packages was to force the separation of interface and data logic.
Additionally it allows parallel development of a separate Shiny \citep{shiny} interface (\cref{sec:online}) using the same wrapper functions.
The collection of packages within the \pkg{iNZight} project are described in \cref{tab:inzight_pkgs}.
Most of these packages have been designed with simple high-level interfaces that are both useful for connecting to the \gls{gui}, but also for beginner \proglang{R} users to use standalone \citep[Sections~3 and 4]{Burr_2021}.

pkgs <- c(
    "\\pkg{iNZight}" = 'The main package for the \\gls{gui}',
    "\\pkg{iNZightModules}" = "An additional \\gls{gui} package providing additional modules for the main \\pkg{iNZight} program.",
    "\\pkg{iNZightPlots}" = "Provides plot function \\fct{inzplot} along with \\fct{inzsummary} for descriptive statistics and \\fct{inzinference} for inference and hypothesis testing.",

    linesep = "",
    escape = FALSE) %>%

\subsection{Usage}\label{sec:usage}

At its core, \pkg{iNZight} is an \proglang{R} package that can be installed and run like any other (see \cref{sec:installation}).
Once installed, the main program can be started by calling the function of the same name:
<<manual_usage,eval=FALSE>>=
library("iNZight")
iNZight()
@
This can optionally take a \code{data} argument, which will launch \pkg{iNZight} with the data loaded and ready to explore.
The \code{data} argument could also be used within an \proglang{R} script used by a research group, where the data needs to be loaded in a specific way (for example, from a secure database).
Users of the \pkg{iNZight} \gls{gui} need only source a script similar to the following.
\begin{CodeInput}
library("DBI")
con <- dbConnect(...)
tbl_data <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT ...")
library("iNZight")
iNZight(data = tbl_data)
\end{CodeInput}

For development purposes, it is preferable to initialize the \gls{gui} object manually:
\begin{CodeInput}
ui <- iNZGUI$new()
ui$initializeGui()
\end{CodeInput}
This way, developers have access to the \class{iNZGUI} object and can explore states and trigger actions for easier testing.
In these next two commands, the first returns the dimensions of the current data, while the second sets the \emph{Variable 1} drop-down (\code{V1box}) value to \code{height}.
\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> dim(ui$getActiveData())
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] 500  10
\end{CodeOutput}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> ui$ctrlWidget$V1box$set_value("height")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}
The second line would trigger the plotting of `height'.
